# Tiktok Might Be Out Again And Its Not Trump This Time

Attention, Tiktokers! 
Biden's ramping up his efforts to mitigate the risk of economic and military threats from China, which includes a possible TikTok ban. 

Yep, you read that right. 

The app that brought you endless hours of mindless scrolling and viral dance challenges could be on the chopping block. In fact, there's already been a [federal ban on TikTok for government devices](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/1143/actions), and several states have followed suit with similar restrictions. 

But it doesn't stop there. 

A [bipartisan bill is currently under review](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/3876321-tiktok-ban-makes-progress-toward-president/), which would give the President the power to ban TikTok and other apps that transfer sensitive personal data to anyone connected with China. Yes. The same President [who dropped the last one's bill to ban tiktok)](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57413227) is now pushing for the same goal. 

The threat of a nationwide ban (again) looms large, sending shockwaves through the online community. It looks like there's a real chance that TikTok could be banned this time, which could have significant implications for both influencers and investors. 

Imagine waking up one day to find that your go-to app for entertainment, inspiration, and communication is suddenly gone. And for those who've built careers and audiences on TikTok, the prospect of losing that platform could be devastating. But it's not just the TikTok stars who could be affected. 

Investors are also taking the heat. With so much uncertainty in the air, it's hard to say what the future holds for TikTok and its users. Will the app survive the latest crackdown on China? Or will we all have to find a new way to pass the time? Only time will tell.
