For the first time in my life, I am seeing Congress, republicans and democrats coming together to fully unanimously agree on something, and it's over a dancing app, Tiktok. 

Congress is getting a lot of fire from it's American citizens after a court hearing with Tiktok CEO was broadcasted live on the app's streaming services. Members of congress are being scrutinized for their seemingly lack of knowledge in the technology field, or just how simple at-home wifi works. 

Tons of meme edits and capcut templates are showing up from the congressional hearing, even Chew is coming out and posting a thank you to their supporters. He made sure to highlight the 150 million Americans who use Tiktok as their primary source of social media, tips and tricks, and even as a news outlet. 

Even well-known users like @ugolord, who makes the "Lawyer's Reaction" videos, with 6.5 million followers commented this on Chew's most recent Tiktok post.

While it's easy to agree that the Members of Congress present at this hearing seemed to not do anything but waste their measly five minutes of time they had. I want to talk more about why, if this is just a fun video editing app for kids, congress is so passionate about this ban. 

## Why Does Congress Really Want to Ban the APP?

This battle between Tiktok and the U.S. government has been going on since the Trump ERA, and it's not stopping here. [Biden, who ironically vetoed Trump's bill to ban Tiktok last year, is now pushing for the same thing.](https://www.dyanabutler.com/blog/posts/angle2tiktok) This is due to the growing suspicion behind Tiktok's security and privacy policies, as well as it's [addictive features and risky trends.](https://7news.com.au/technology/tiktok/girl-dies-trying-dangerous-tiktok-challenge-during-call-with-classmates--c-9481497) But mainly, this is really about the U.S. having total control over a media that is widely being used and defended by their own citizens. 

*"We would characterize today's testimony by TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew in the Beltway as a "disaster" moment."* Dan Ives, a tech analyst on Wall Street, posted a [twitter post](https://twitter.com/DivesTech/status/1638954571304419328) stating that if Bytedance didn't sell to the U.S. by end of 2023 there will be a fullscale ban.

But American Tiktok creators had differing opinions on the hearing, calling out for their viewers to speak to their local congressman to stop this from going into effect.

While I can agree it's ironic to see Congressmen highlight how this ban is for the safety of their children while school shootings are still prevalent and rarely broadcasted on any major news outlet these days. It's also weird to think that the CEO of a company has our best interests at heart. 

TikTok spokesperson Brooke Oberwetter said. “Also not mentioned today by members of the Committee: the livelihoods of the 5 million businesses on TikTok or the First Amendment implications of banning a platform loved by 150 million Americans.” 

## The Difference Between Our Country Having Access to Our Data over China

Now we all know that Facebook, Snapchat, and Twitter have gone under fire over similar privary concerns. Tiktok creators are calling it hypocritical but fail to realize that the U.S. is not immune to the rest of the world and we've been in an ever-growing geopolitical conflict with China.  Rep. Greg Pence, R-Ind., noted this was the 32nd hearing Congress has held on Big Tech. 

The difference between Facebook META having access to our data over a Chinese company is just that. The U.S. believes there's no way of having complete control over the app and where our data goes until Bytedance completely sells its North America division over. 

Project Texas, a $1.5 billion project that involves the relocation of all U.S. user data from company servers to the Oracle servers in Texas, has been in the works. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew gave a deadline of the end-of-year to hopefully ease tensions and avoid a fullscale ban. 
*“We have legacy U.S. data sitting in our servers in Virginia and in Singapore. We’re deleting those we expect that to be complete this year,”* he said. 

While this eliminates the concern over Tiktok's agenda of spying on people, this doesn't change the fact that Chinese officials can still access this data until it's completely deleted. Chew was asked if Tiktok would commit to selling U.S. user data to anyone, and it came with a inconclusive answer, Chew simply saying he would have to "get back to you" when further pushed for interrogation. 

## Does This Invalidate Our First Amendment Rights? 

Is this an infringement on our First Amendment Rights? or is the other way around where China, a communist party, infringing on our American right to privacy. 

Tiktok users seem to be irate and disappointed in Congress over this decision, making the point over and over that there's no data to steal if all they're doing is making memes or watching edits. For me, this goes to show that there is little to no education on geopolitical tensions and it's a gentle reminder that the U.S. is not immune to war. 

It does confuse me that 100% of the content I was seeing on my FYP about this hearing was heavily edited and put Chew in a hero-like light. If this doesn't back up the claim on whether Tiktok runs anti-rhetoric against members of the White House to make their own citizens turn their backs on them, then I don't know what does. 

On Thursday, Rep. Kat Cammack, R-Fla., played a video she found on TikTok showing what appeared to be an animated gun continuously reloading with the caption “Me asf at the, House Energy and Commerce Committee on 3/23/23.” TikTok removed the video at during the hearing.

## Congress Members That Have Stocks In Facebook's META, Snap

Seemingly, this Tiktok hearing did nothing but hand Zuckerberg and all shareholders in Meta and SNAP, a victory. With stocks jumping as much as 4% and 10%.

## What Do I Do If Tiktok DOES Get Banned? 

Get a VPN. Period.
