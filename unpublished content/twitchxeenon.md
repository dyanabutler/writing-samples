# Xeenon: A Captivating Option Amidst the Debate Over Twitch's Ad Rules

While browsing Twitter comments about [Twitch's new Ad guidelines](https://kotaku.com/twitch-branded-content-rules-streaming-ads-revenue-1850512350), I stumbled upon Xeenon.xyz, an intriguing Web3 streaming platform that connects blockchain to content creating. It offers a unique concept of paying in ETH just for streaming on the platform. Could this be an evolutionary alternative to Twitch's current state?

## What is Xeenon?

Xeenon is a Web3 streaming platform that leverages blockchain technology and the Livepeer network to provide creators with a transparent and rewarding ecosystem where they can monetize their content through ETH payments and enhanced streaming experiences.

Twitch and Xeenon are similar in the sense that they both offer live streaming capabilities, allowing creators to share their content with viewers in real-time. Both platforms provide a space for creators to engage with their communities and showcase their talent or interests.

### What's Xeenon's Strategy for Paying New Streamers?

Let's take a closer look at Xeenon and its creators at Graviton. Graviton is aiming for a 'Collab Economy' where creators and fans thrive together. They're making this possible with their Creator Revenue Sharing Model (CRSM) that lets creators earn from the get-go, sidestepping the usual reliance on ads and fan payments.

Rewinding to 2022, Graviton was all in on shaping Xeenon, constructing a platform with rapid, instant payments for creators and a unique back-end integration into the Livepeer transcoding protocol.

Now, as we enter the present, Phase 2 is in full swing, unveiling their innovative Creator Revenue Sharing Model. By expanding to a multi-region strategy, Xeenon will be able to handle transcoding jobs from all over the world, which should increase the amount of Ethereum (ETH) they earn from the protocol.  They've also increased their Fee Cut to 60% and Reward Cut to 15%, with rewards tied to total streaming time.

**Fee Cut:** This represents a portion of the Ethereum ETH paid to the Xeenon platform, also referred to as the "orchestrator," for performing video transcoding tasks on the Livepeer network. 
Transcoding is the process of cohenverting a video file from one format to another to ensure it can be played on various devices and internet speeds.

**Reward Cut:** This refers to $LPT rewards, a different type of cryptocurrency associated with the Livepeer network. The term "inflationary" implies that the total supply of $LPT increases over time, and these additional tokens are given as rewards to service providers like Xeenon for their participation in the network.

## How Can Blockchain Improve Streaming?

**Decentralization:** By utilizing the blockchain, Xeenon creates a system that is not controlled by any single entity, providing an equal playing field for all streamers. It's a shift from the traditional model where platforms like Twitch dictate the rules.

**Transparency:** Blockchain's open ledger system offers unparalleled transparency. Every transaction, including payments to creators in ETH, is recorded and can be verified by anyone. This transparency fosters trust between the platform, streamers, and their audience.

**Security:** Blockchain's immutable and cryptographic nature provides a secure environment where transactions and data are highly resistant to hacking and fraud.

**Low Fees & Instant Payments:** The use of the Arbitrum blockchain allows for low transaction fees. This means that more of the earnings go directly to the creators. Payments are also processed instantaneously, a significant upgrade from traditional platforms where payout periods can be lengthy.

**Incorporation of DAI:** DAI, a stablecoin cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to the US Dollar, can be integrated into the system. This provides stability against the notorious volatility of cryptocurrencies, ensuring that streamers' earnings don't fluctuate wildly with market swings.

**Tokenization Opportunities:** Xeenon can potentially introduce unique tokenization features for the community. Streamers can mint their own tokens representing digital assets or even stake in their streaming channels, opening up new ways for fan interaction and monetization.

## Do I Have To Get A Crypto Wallet Now? 

Not at all! Despite Xeenon's utilization of crytocurrency, it doesn't require users to get tangled up with a crypto wallet from the get-go. 

With the innovative integration of [Privy.io](https://www.privy.io/about), anyone can set up an account and start earning on Xeenon without the need for those pesky self-custodial wallets, unless that's your cup of tea. 

For those crypto enthusiasts out there, traditional providers like Metamask are an option too. 

This dual approach broadens accessibility and simplifies use, especially for those who are initially skeptical about cryptocurrencies.
