*TLDR; Explore the Google IT Support Professional Certificate, a program that offers positive career outcomes for 75% of graduates within six months, preparation for CompTIA A+ exams, and up to 15 college credits at the bachelor's degree level, providing a pathway for newbies like you and me!*

Hey there, it's Dyana again, your self-proclaimed Web Engineer who's fresh off the retail boat. Welcome to Day 2 of my commitment to something I'm ACTUALLY going to see through this time. Today, I want to talk about something that's been a game-changer for me: The Google IT Support Professional Certificate.

Okay, I know that was a mouthful... and you're probably wondering where I'm going with this. But stick with me, because this could be the key to breaking free from the retail grind and stepping into a more fulfilling career.

Google has managed to fly under the radar with this course. Sure, people talk about it, but do they really talk about it?

- 75% of certificate graduates report a positive career outcome (e.g., new job, promotion, or raise) within **six months** of completionÂ².

- This program also **prepares you for the CompTIA A+ exams**, the industry standard certification for ITâ€”youâ€™ll earn a dual credential when you complete both.

- This program is ACEÂ® approvedâ€”when you complete, **you can earn up to 15 college credits**, the equivalent of 5 college courses at a bachelorâ€™s degree level.

**So what does this all mean?** Let's break it down:

- *Positive Career Outcomes:* Think of this like leveling up in a video game. 75% of people who finish this course get a new job, a promotion, or a pay raise within six months. Upon completion of this course, you also get put on a special recruiterâ€™s list.

- *Preparation for CompTIA A+ Exams*: Imagine having a special key that unlocks a secret door. This course gives you that key by preparing you for the CompTIA A+ exams. These exams are like a golden ticket in the IT world, proving you have the skills needed for an entry-level job.

- *Earn College Credits:* Picture this as a shortcut on a race track. By completing this program, you can earn up to 15 college credits. That's like skipping ahead five whole college courses at the bachelor's degree level. Talk about a head start!

I have to admit, I'm only currently on the 3rd module of this course, but I wanted to talk about it now because it already lives up to its hype.
